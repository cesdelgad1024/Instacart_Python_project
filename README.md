# Instacart Python Portfolio

Welcome to the **Instacart Python Portfolio**! This project showcases data analysis, cleaning, and visualization using Python on a dataset from the Instacart grocery ordering platform.

---

## Overview

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate advanced Python programming and data analysis skills. This project analyzes the Instacart dataset to extract insights, visualize trends, and generate reports that could inform business decisions.

### Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Customer segmentation and profiling.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualizations using Python libraries.
- Aggregated insights and actionable findings.

---

## Dataset

**Source**: The dataset contains millions of grocery orders placed via Instacart. It includes:
- Orders: Details of customer purchases.
- Products: Information about items sold.
- Aisles and Departments: Product categorizations.
- Customers: Anonymous user data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis:

1. **1_data_types.ipynb**:
   - Introduction to data types and their usage in the dataset.

2. **2_pandas.ipynb**:
   - Data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.

3. **3_data_wrangling_and_subsetting.ipynb**:
   - Techniques for cleaning data and creating subsets for analysis.

4. **4_data_consistency_checks.ipynb**:
   - Ensuring data consistency and integrity throughout the dataset.

5. **5_combining_and_exporting_data_part1.ipynb** & **5_combining_and_exporting_data_part2.ipynb**:
   - Merging datasets and exporting the cleaned data for further analysis.

6. **6_deriving_new_variables.ipynb**:
   - Creating new variables to enhance analysis capabilities.

7. **7_grouping_data_and_aggregating_variables.ipynb**:
   - Grouping data and calculating aggregate statistics.

8. **8_data_visualization_part1.ipynb** & **8_data_visualization_part2.ipynb**:
   - Visualizing data trends and patterns using various plotting techniques.

9. **10_coding_etiquette.ipynb**:
   - Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.
